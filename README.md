\# ESEA App – Student \& Admin Management System



\## 📌 Project Overview

The \*\*ESEA App\*\* is a full-stack academic management application designed to handle \*\*student timetables, courses, materials, and administration tasks\*\* in a structured and scalable way.



The system consists of:

\- A \*\*Flutter mobile application\*\* for students and admins

\- A \*\*FastAPI backend\*\* that provides secure REST APIs

\- A \*\*PostgreSQL database\*\* for persistent data storage



The project follows \*\*clean frontend–backend contracts\*\*, modular design, and real-world app development practices.

\## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1\. User logs in using SSO

2\. Backend verifies OAuth token

3\. JWT token is issued

4\. Role (student/admin) is determined server-side

5\. Secure APIs are accessed using JWT



---



\## 📅 Timetable Module

\- Timetable is fetched using `/timetable/student`

\- Slot-based system using `slot\_code`

\- Conflict detection is handled in frontend logic

\- Running class detection based on current time

\- API response is cached for performance



---



\## 🧪 Error Handling

\- Backend returns structured JSON error responses

\- Frontend handles:

&nbsp; - Network errors

&nbsp; - Empty responses

&nbsp; - Authentication failures

\- Loading indicators and fallback UI are implemented

\## ▶️ How to Run the Project



\### ✅ Prerequisites

\- Flutter SDK installed

\- Python 3.10+

\- PostgreSQL installed and running

\- Git

\### 🖥️ Backend Setup (FastAPI)



1\. Navigate to backend directory:

```bash

cd esea-backend



2\. Create and activate virtual environment:



python -m venv venv

venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows

\# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS





3\. Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt





4\. Set environment variables (example):



DATABASE\_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/esea\_db

SSO\_CLIENT\_ID=your\_client\_id

SSO\_AUTH\_URL=your\_sso\_auth\_url

SECRET\_KEY=your\_secret\_key





5\. Run backend server:



uvicorn app.main:app --reload





Backend will start at:



http://127.0.0.1:8000



**### Frontend Setup (Flutter)**



1.Navigate to frontend directory:



cd esea\_app





2.Install Flutter dependencies:



flutter pub get





3.Ensure backend URL is correct:



// lib/constants/api\_constants.dart

static const String baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api";





4.Run the app:



flutter run



🧠 Design Decisions



API-driven architecture



Strongly typed models



Centralized API constants



Backend controls business logic



Frontend focuses on UI and state management



🔄 Future Improvements



UI/UX enhancements



Attendance tracking



Push notifications



Offline support



Docker-based deployment



Separate development and production environments
